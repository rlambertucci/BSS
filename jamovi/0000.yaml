  This module offers a varied set of statistical procedures for diverse data
  analysis needs. Features include:  1) Network Analysis;  2) Missing values
  analysis and data imputation using the missRanger package;  3) Post-hoc
  analysis for MANOVA using Descriptive Discriminant Analysis (including effect
  size calculation);  4) Outlier detection using box-plot and modified z-score
  with adjustable thresholds;  5) Sample size calculation for finite populations
  (two different formulas) and for experimental design with animals (Resource
  Equation Approach);  6) Statistical comparison of correlation coefficients
  (independent and dependent).
